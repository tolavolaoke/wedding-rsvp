        <h1>Kido</h1>

          <p>The first time I saw her was at our mutual friend Stephen's mums house. 
              We all gathered for his birthday BBQ. They had know each other for a while and I knew Stephen from university. 
              I didn't make a move at that time because I don't like approaching females so I let it pass, 
              thank God I got another chance. 
              The very next day Stephen invited me and my boys to chill at his university house to enjoy the summer and the end of exams. 
              As I walked in I saw her and remember thinking ' the girl from the BBQ is here'. 
              She was also chilling at Stephens with her friend Andreea. 
              We started talking first just as a group then I started directing my questions to her. 
              She said her name was Josephine and that she was Nigerian which made me want to know more so I asked which tribe. 
              She said she was igbo. This drew me in even more and I identified well with that part of her. 
              I was definitely interested at this point but continued to play it cool as usual. 
              I asked her more questions but she wouldn't answer most of them
              I left early that night and remember telling her I'll see her later. I spoke to Stephen later that night and asked him to set me up with that girl and asked if she was seeing anyone. 
              He said he would try but also warned me that she wasn't a girl to play around or joke with, that she was a serious one. 
              I said yes yes no games with her. That night I checked her Instagram pictures and she was looking on point, 
              I knew I was making the right choice to talk to her that night.

          <h1>Jojo</h1>
            <p>I first saw him at our mutual friend Stephen's uni house. 
                He walked in with this friend Giquina and we all just chilled and played card games. 
                I noticed him more once we started talking. 
                I remember asking him if he was Ghanian and the look he gave me was priceless, 
                I knew then that I had gotten that wrong.
                He corrected me and said Nigerian and in fact igbo just like me. 
                I was definitely shocked because he didn't look Nigerian to me. 
                I remember smiling at my friend, Andreea when he said he was igbo.
                We spoke some more but I couldn't make out if he was interested or not. 
                He asked me what my igbo name was but I refused to tell him . 
                The night went on and he left earlier than the rest of us.
                Before he left, I told me he would see later and I remember thinking you don't know me how will you see me later lol, 
                little did I know ey. The next day, I received a friend request on Instagram from him. 
                I followed back and of course checked out his pictures which were all nice. Couple of days later, 
                a text from Stephen came in saying his boy wanted my number. 
                I knew straight away that it was him and gave Stephen the go ahead to give it to him. 
                Not long after I received a text message saying ' I'm still waiting for that igbo name'. 
                That makes me laugh still until now.
